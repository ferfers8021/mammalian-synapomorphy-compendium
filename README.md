# Mammalian Synapomorphy Compendium

A collaborative, version-controlled compendium documenting and comparing the key anatomical and physiological innovations (synapomorphies) that define mammals and their major subgroups.

## Project Overview

This repository serves as a reference guide focusing on the evolutionary transitions from therapsid ancestors to modern monotremes and placental mammals.

## Planned Sections

1. **Middle Ear Evolution** - Transition from articular-quadrate to mammalian ossicles
2. **Endothermy and Hair** - Evolution of mammalian thermoregulation and integument
3. **Dentition and Jaw Musculature** - Differentiation of teeth and jaw muscle arrangement
4. **Neocortex and Corpus Callosum** - Brain evolution in mammals
5. **Reproductive Innovations** - Placental vs. marsupial vs. monotreme reproductive strategies
6. **Limbs and Locomotion** - Postural changes and adaptations

## How to Contribute

- Each synapomorphy will be documented in a separate markdown file under the `compendium/` directory.
- Use GitHub Issues to propose new topics or revisions.
- Follow the branch–pull request–review workflow for additions.
